## Overview

This project aims to optimize the management of returnable assets, such as beer bottles, by creating a data platform to improve communication and reduce inefficiencies among various stakeholders.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues:

-   **Complex Communication**: Numerous stakeholders with different communication formats and platforms leading to mistakes.
-   **Empty Kilometers**: Costly and environmentally harmful due to inefficient logistics.
-   **Manual Labor**: High level of manual intervention required.
-   **Data Sharing**: Inadequate information sharing among stakeholders.

### Impact on Stakeholders:

-   **Breweries**: Lack direct data, have faulty deliveries, and pay for empty kilometers.
-   **Supermarkets**: Manual communication with breweries and making independent forecasts.
-   **Logistics Companies**: Drive many empty kilometers and need clearer communication.

## Goal

Develop a data platform enabling direct data input from all stakeholders to:

-   Minimize miscommunication.
-   Reduce empty kilometers.
-   Decrease manual labor.
-   Enhance planning reliability.
-   Lower the occurrence of misplaced bottles.

## Approach

### Research Process:

1.  **Exploratory Research**: Analyze stakeholders to understand motivations and needs.
2.  **Prototyping**: Develop prototypes (Bi-Lateral, Central, Federated).
3.  **Feedback & Improvement**: Iterative process to refine prototypes based on stakeholder feedback.

### Prototypes:

-   **Bi-Lateral**: Simple, direct data sharing between two parties.
-   **Central**: A central hub for data collection and dissemination.
-   **Federated**: Distributed data sharing model ensuring data privacy and autonomy.

## Implementation

### Technologies Used:

-   **Nuxt 3**: Framework for building user interfaces.
-   **Typescript**: Language for application development.
-   **Java Springboot**: Backend framework.
-   **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
-   **PostgreSQL 16**: Database management system.

### Challenges:

-   **Time Management**: Coordinating project timelines across different phases.
-   **Multi-Dimensional Structure**: Handling complex data structures and interactions.

## Results

The implemented data platform demonstrated significant improvements in communication and logistics efficiency:

-   **Fewer Empty Kilometers**: Optimized routes reduced unnecessary travel.
-   **Reduced Manual Labor**: Automated data input decreased the need for manual interventions.
-   **Improved Planning**: More accurate and reliable logistics planning.

## Future Directions

To further enhance the system, the following steps are recommended:

-   Expand the data platform to include more stakeholders.
-   Continuously monitor and optimize communication protocols.
-   Implement advanced data analytics for better decision-making.

## Conclusion

Effective data sharing and communication among stakeholders are crucial for optimizing returnable assets. By leveraging a federated data sharing model, we can significantly reduce inefficiencies and improve overall logistics operations.
